# Introduction
This week, I have read some materials related to machine learning, reinforcement learning and combinatorial optimization. Although I havn't figure it out cearly, it's hard to define the term "figure it out clearly". I believe learning by iteration is a good choice to master a new skills, I'll try to summarize what I've got now.

# Intuitions
For the problem of planning, the methods can fall into two categories: model-free learner and model-based solver. Learner needs trainning, which means it can not cope with new problems without data; However, solver can deal with problems with no trainning data but after some delibrations. The AlphaZero is actually an effective integration of learner and solver.

I believe the combination of learner and solver will the future of general artificial intelligence.
