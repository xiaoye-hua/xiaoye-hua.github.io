# Problem
Leetcode problems:
1. 136 sinlge number
2. 137 single number II
3. 260 single num III


# Solution
There are two aprroches to solve these problems
1. Hash table: hash table is a very important tool to solve problem related to array. dict in Python is implemented with hash table.
2. Bit manipulation: not so clear about this approach, I'll add these part latter


## Hash Table
Take 137 as an example, solutions are as follows:
```python
from typing import List


class Solution:
    def singleNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        common_time = 3
        special_time = 1
        result_dict = {}
        for n in nums:
            try:
                result_dict[n] += 1
                if result_dict[n] == common_time:
                    del result_dict[n]
            except:
                result_dict[n] = 1
        return list(result_dict.keys())[0]
```


## Bit Manipulation
I'll cover the approach latter.
