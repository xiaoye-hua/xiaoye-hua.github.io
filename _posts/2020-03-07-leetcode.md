# Problem
Inspired from problem 26 and 80 from leetcode, problem has been changed to be as follow:

Given a sorted array nums, remove the duplicates in-place such that each element appear only **max_appear_time** and return the new length. Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

# Solution
This problem is related to the topic of array and two pointers.

```python
from typing import List


class Solution:
    def removeDuplicates(self, nums: List[int], max_appear_time: int) -> int:
        """
        Inspired from discussion
        Refer to 26. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array
        """
        if not nums:
            return
        i = 0
        # flag = False
        # max_appear_time = 1
        appear_time = 1
        for j in range(1, lBackspace String Compareen(nums)):
            if nums[i] == nums[j]:
                if appear_time != max_appear_time:
                    # flag = True
                    appear_time += 1
                    i += 1
                    nums[i], nums[j] = nums[j], nums[i]
            else:
                appear_time = 1
                # flag = False
                i += 1
                nums[i], nums[j] = nums[j], nums[i]
        return i + 1
```
Methond of two pointer is used in this problems. Similar problems using two pointer methods are:
1. 283 move zeros
2. 27 remove element
