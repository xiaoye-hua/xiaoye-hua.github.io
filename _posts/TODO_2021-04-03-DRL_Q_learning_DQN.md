# Introduction
This is the course summaries of UC Berkeley CS285 deep reinforcement learning. From the goal of reinforcement learning, we can derive policy gradient methods. However, it suffers the problems of high variance. In order to solve this problem, causality and baselines methods are used. Gradient policy methods is a type of on-policy methods, which is a special case of off-policy learning.
