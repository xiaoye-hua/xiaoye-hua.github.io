## Problem Definition

1. Approaches
    1. Direct max-rev pricing strategy
        1. By tracking how demand varies with respect to price for a large number of identical products, a demand curve F (P) can be estimated, which determines demand as a function of price P. Then the problem of revenue maximization is to find the price P that yields maximal PÃ—F (P). The key to the success of this approach is to get an accurate estimation of the demand function F (P)
    2. 2 component solution: 
       1. purchase probability + revenue optimization (Airbnb, Airline ancillariers, Alibab)
          1. alibaba, airline: purchase probability + revenue optimization
          2. airbnb: Predict optimal price directly; then apply business constrain 
    3. 1 component solution -> combine the above 2 components to 1 single model (airline ancillaries)
    4. Meituan solution
       1. from the perspective from hotel -> recommendate price for each hotel 
    5. Casual inference -> AWS solution

## Offline Evaluation
In the work from Airbnb, a set of offline metrics are developed, which were adopted by Meituan, Alibaba & Airline company. Below is the logics and definition of these metrics:
