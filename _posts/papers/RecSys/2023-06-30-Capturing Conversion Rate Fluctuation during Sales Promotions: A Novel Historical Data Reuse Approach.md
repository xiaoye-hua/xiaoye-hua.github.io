1. Introduction
{:toc}
		
## Problem Definition


1. We covered three aspects beyond the choice of algorithm: 
    1. Modelling
    2. Experimentation 
    3. Serving
2. In this paper 
    1. challenges and solutions
    2. display an overview of the business gains of the step changes in the Machine Learning ranking of Booking.com.
3. Main conclusion
    1. Our main conclusion is that there are multiple aspects that need to be
carefully addressed for the creation of a Machine Learned ranker
in a large-scale commercial setting.
## Methods
1. Modelling
    1. Signals definition
    2. Feature representation
    3. Bias
2. Experimentation
    1. Leakage: retraining and features
    2. Speed of experiment: interleaving 
3. Serving

## Impact

1. Improvements of each step: refer to plot


## TODO & Questions & Further Reading

1. [ ] re-training leakage -> Isolated feedback loops of data -> why & potential influence ??
2. [ ] can borrow some feature from feature representation
3. [ ] signal definition -> useful
