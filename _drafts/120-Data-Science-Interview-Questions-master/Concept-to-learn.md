1. covariate shift
3. Target variable VS predictor variable
    1. Target variable, in the machine learning context is the variable that is or should be the output. For example it could be binary 0 or 1 if you are classifying or it could be a continuous variable if you are doing a regression. In statistics you also refer to it as the response variable.
Predictor variables in the machine learning context the the input data or the variables that is mapped to the target variable through an empirical relation ship usually determined through the data. In statistics you you refer to them as predictors. Each set of predictors may be called as an observation.
